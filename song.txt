End of passion play
Crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear
Sucking darkeness clear
Leading on your death's construction

Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your
Master
Master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
